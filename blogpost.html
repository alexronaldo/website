         <p class="font1">Baer's family fled Germany just before World War II and Baer served the American war effort, gaining an interest in electronics shortly thereafter. Through several jobs in the electronics industry, he was working as an engineer at Sanders Associates (now BAE Systems)[1] in Nashua, NH, when he conceived the idea of playing games on a television screen around 1966. With support of his employers, he worked through several prototypes until he arrived at a "Brown Box" that would later become the blueprint for the first home video game console, licensed by Magnavox as the Magnavox Odyssey. Baer continued to design several other consoles and computer game units, including contributing to design of the Simon electronic game. Baer continued to work in electronics until his death in 2014, with over 150 patents to his name.

            Baer is considered "the Father of Video Games" due to his many contributions to games and helping to spark the video game industry in the latter half of the 20th century.[2] In February, 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology for "his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms".</p>
         <p class="font1">By the end of 2021, the worldwide online gaming industry is expected to be worth a whopping $2.2 trillion.

            Back in 2015, the sector was worth $1.72 trillion. This represents an increase of $480 billion in just six years – reflecting a growth rate so huge it could almost be called a revolution.</p>
         <p class="font1">More Platforms will Support Cryptocurrency
Bitcoin took the world by storm back in 2009, and as its price continues to rocket amid a market-wide bull run, many people are wondering whether crypto is going to become more mainstream.

Because cryptocurrency and gaming are two of the most progressive industries when it comes to technology, it’s no surprise that the two are rapidly integrating.

From online Bitcoin casinos to the launch of Litecoin’s very own role-playing game, Litebringer, we’re starting to see lots of gaming platforms embrace the possibilities of the blockchain.

If recent trends are anything to go by, it’s clear we should expect to see this relationship strengthen in the future.</p>
         <p class="font1">Video Games in the Olympics?
            In 2019, the inaugural Fortnite World Cup signalled an important shift.
            
            For decades, gaming had an unflattering reputation – an antisocial activity that was almost a byword for laziness.
            
            But as millions of people around the world watched gamers battle it out for a share of the $30 million prize pool, it soon became clear that the gaming industry was far more powerful than was previously thought.
            
            The spectator sport was such a success that it even prompted people to ask whether video games should be included in the next Olympics!
            
            Although there’s no sign that this dream will become a reality any time soon, it seems likely that online gaming tournaments will become more and more popular in the future.</p>
        <p class="font1">More Online Mobile Gaming
            The mobile gaming industry may have been slow to get off the ground, but it’s rapidly making up for lost time.
            
            According to current statistics, more than half of online gaming will take place on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets by 2025.
            
            Thanks to platforms such as Google’s Stadia, it’s now possible to play the same game across a wide range of different devices.
            
            Until recently, the challenge of optimising gameplay for a variety of screen sizes proved too complex – but with the demand for mobile gaming greater than ever, it’s obvious this is an avenue that games developers will continue to embrace in the near furture.
            
            Whether you enjoy playing at Bitcoin casinos from the comfort of your home or prefer to game on the go, these online gambling trends will continue to shape the industry in years to come.</p>
